title: The tenure track position
---

The postdoc meets an old pal at a conference, who tells her that s/he's just got a tenure track position. The postdoc exclaims 'Wow! Cool!'. 

She sees in front of her eyes that really tragic movie, probably some adaptation of Edith Wharton or whatnot, and the heroin is uttering 'I hope you'll be very happy together'.
