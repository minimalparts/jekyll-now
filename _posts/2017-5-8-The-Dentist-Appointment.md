title: The dentist's appointment
---

The postdoc has been trying to go to the dentist's for the last 18 months. Several people have already told her she has a rest of salad leaf on her tooth, but it isn't. It's a cavity that keeps growing. 

The trouble is, dentists are in demand, and the shortest waiting time seems to be four weeks, wherever she goes. Unless you're an emergency, but she is no emergency. Of course, she's never four weeks in any one place, and she also doesn't know where she will be in two months' time, which makes the appointment business impossible. She is trying to explain all this to the dentist's secretary, who looks at her suspiciously.

Back home and in despair, she watches a YouTube video 'How to fix your teeth YOURSELF at home.'
