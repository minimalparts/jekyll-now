title: All best

The postdoc often wonders about politeness formulas. For a long time, she wrote *Kind regards* at the end of her emails, but she realised she was saying it at times when she didn't feel any kindness towards the recipient (as in *Dear X, as per my last two reminders, would you be able to send your review of paper 256 ASAP? Kind regards.*)

Today, she's tired and twice already, has written *All bets* instead of *All best*. Upon consideration, it seems appropriately ambiguous. It can mean anything from *Try and guess how I feel about you right now* to *I have absolutely no idea how to fix the above problem, so let's do what we always do: toss a coin and hope for the best.*

She presses *Send*, just to see.
