title: All best

The postdoc often wonders about politeness formulas. For a long time, she wrote *Kind regards* at the end of her emails, but she slowly realised she was using it even when she didn't feel any kindness towards the recipient (as in *Dear X, as per my last two reminders, would you be able to send your review of paper 256 ASAP? Kind regards.*) So she switched to *All the best*, which she shortens as *All best* when she's a) terribly busy, or b) slightly annoyed.

Today, she's tired and twice already, has written *All bets* instead of *All best*. Upon consideration, it seems appropriately ambiguous. It's something between *Try and guess how I feel about you right now* and *I have absolutely no idea how to fix the above problem, so let's do what we always do: toss a coin and hope for the best.*

She presses *Send*, just to see.
