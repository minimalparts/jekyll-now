title: Meditation

The postdoc's colleagues have all started meditating, in response to the unbearable stess of science. So she's trying it too. The group's guru is a guy called Peter (Buddhist chosen name Bhismasvaraja), who posts meditation practices on Vimeo and has a soothing way to tell you that you're not doing anything wrong. 

The problem is, Bhismasvaraja's intonations occasionally remind her of a colleague who works on Word Sense Disambiguation. And, no offense meant to anybody, the postdoc is not a fan of WSD. She doesn't believe in word senses.

So whenever she practices loving-kindness, and the time comes to switch to 'the difficult person', she visualises Word Sense Disambiguation and murmurs: 'I wish you well', 'I wish you well', 'I wish you to be loved'...
