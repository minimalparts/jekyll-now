title: The Biking Scheme
---

The postdoc has made an important discovery. There is a deterministic relationship between her morning experience with the shared bike scheme and the overall success of her day.

* Gears don't work: stupidly forget the talk by Dr So-and-so.
* Brakes are broken: say something stupid in an email, regret it, write another email to fix it, make it all worse.
* Adjustable bike seat slowly drifts down whilst cycling: realise that the 'insight' from yesterday is shit.
* More than two collisions with an electric unicycle: paper rejected.
* Parking space located without having to cycle all the way back to where she started: imminent scientific breakthrough.

She nearly decided to buy herself her own bike, but what if the seat is forever... not quite right...?
