title: The biking scheme
---

The postdoc has made an important discovery. There is a deterministic relationship between her morning experience with the shared bike scheme and the overall success of her day. The following translation rules are of particular relevance.

* Gears don't work --> stupidly forget the talk by Dr So-and-so.
* Brakes are broken --> say something silly in an email, regret it, write another email to fix it, make it all worse.
* Adjustable bike seat slowly drifts down whilst cycling --> realise that the 'insight' from yesterday is a load of baloney.
* More than two collisions with an electric unicycle --> paper rejected.
* Locate an official parking space without having to cycle all the way back home --> imminent scientific breakthrough.

She's very close to buying herself her own bike. But what if the seat is forever... not quite right...?
