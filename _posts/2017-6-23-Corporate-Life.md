The postdoc feels like a corporation -- not a successful one, obviously; rather one of those companies that look good on paper but are on the brink of bankruptcy.

Since 2011. Offices in Cambridge, Berlin, Bolzano, Barcelona and Trifouillis-les-Oies.

Reasonable turnover but highly unclear balance sheet. The company could be healthy or it could be bust, depending on finicky aspects of European health insurance laws. The CEO herself doesn't know.

Dodgy product that promises the Earth. (*Our developed theory bridges across two fields of semantics that were previously thought to be formally and philosophically incompatible.*)

She's made herself a little landing pad out of a post-it block, and she hovers over it with her purple 'Yahoo research' pen, picked up somewhere at a conference. 

She always wanted a helicopter.
