title: Slide 23
---

People are telling the postdoc how much they enjoyed her talk, and the joke on slide 23 was particularly excellent, and she is such a relaxed speaker. She says she's very glad they found the topic bearable.

At the restaurant, she orders some innocuous vegetarian dish but finds it hard to swallow. Her stomach is stil inconvenienced by the massive panic attack of the morning during which, ironically, slide 23 came to her mind. She mentally ticks the day as another one of those near-death experiences, and wonders how many more lives she has in store.
