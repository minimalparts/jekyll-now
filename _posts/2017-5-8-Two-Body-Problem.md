\- I have missed you sooo much!  
\- I miss you too! All the time! But I'm coming soon...  
\- Have you booked your flight?  
\- Yes. I'm arriving on May 12th.  
\- Ah. Sorry. I hadn't told you. I have to go to Jena then, to give a talk.  
\- Oh.  
\- But I'm already back on the Sunday.  
\- I'm gone then. I'm doing that block seminar thingie in ZÃ¼rich.  
\- Oh yes, right. Where are you after that?  
\- Ljubljana. Conference.    
\- When is that?   
\- 17th to 20th.  
\- That's brilliant! I'm in Venice! We could come back home for the weekend with the night train! Meet in Munich or somewhere.  
\- How romantic!  
\- Unbelievably romantic!  
\- So what time could you get to Munich?  
\- Uh... let me check the trains... if I rush, 21:55.  
\- The night train seems to depart at 21:47.  
\- Oh.  
\- Then we travel separately.  
\- Trouble is, I anyway have to travel on and get back to work. I'll have been away for 10 days...  
\- Yes, of course.   
\- ...  
\- Well, when can you come again?  
\- How about June 10th? Are you free?  
\- Uh, 10th, yes!!! I'm home!  
\- Wow, cool! Then June 10th.  
\- June 10th it is!  
\- June 10th, yes.  
\- I love you.  
\- I love you too.
