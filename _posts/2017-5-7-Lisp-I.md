The postdoc meets her friend Alicia at the department, and tells her about that dream she had. Two of her colleagues had turned into vectors, *v* and *w*, and she had been forced to put them through function *F*, pointwise, so they horribly merged into each other. She'd wanted to stop it, desperately, but there was no way to get back to the original input. When they'd fully merged into some awful chimera, she had screamed and woken up.

Alicia says right, yeah, she once dreamt she was a piece of Lisp code.
