The postdoc is experiencing a very faint feeling of guilt, as she emails her friend Emilia with an urgent request:

*Hey, what was that paper again with the language universals and the suspiciousy/disgustingly good results? I need to cite it NOW. Hugs.*

She presses 'send' and shrugs off the guilt. It is Saturday night, 11:17pm. For sure, Emilia is still working. Then, there's nothing to feel guilty about, is there?
