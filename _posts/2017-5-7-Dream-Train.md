title: The dream train
---

The postdoc dreams that she has to get on a train but the train has been stolen. Many colleagues are there too, waiting to travel. A man comes and tells everybody they have to get on the stolen train and find out where it might have gone. If they succeed, they will get a research grant. They all crowd onto the platform and get onto the vanished train, where they search, and search, and search.
