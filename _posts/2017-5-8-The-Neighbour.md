title: The neighbour
---

The postdoc is at home on holiday. She went to bed at 2:37am, having sorted out a few pressing emails, fixed an urgent bug, and commented on a student's report. It is a beautiful day and she stumbles out into the garden with a cup of coffee. It is 10 am. She sits on the grass, closes her eyes and breathes... When she reopens them, she notices that the neighbour has popped his head above the separating hedge. He smiles a friendly smile and calls out:

'Breakfasting now? It's nice to be a student, hey?'
