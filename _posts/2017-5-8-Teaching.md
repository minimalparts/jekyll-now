The postdoc worries she does not completely master the topic she will be teaching tomorrow. So she stays up very late, reading the latest research, to try and catch any potential gap in her understanding. She comes out of her reading in a state of full dissociation with her body, convinced that things are much more complex than she'd first thought.

The following (or rather same) day, the class is nearly over, and she must control a slight quiver in her voice as she asks: 'Are there any questions?' 

A student raises his hand.

'Will this be in the exam?'
